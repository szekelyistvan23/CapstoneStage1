# CapstoneStage1

What Will I Learn?

Through this project, you'll demonstrate the ability to communicate an app idea formally, using:

    - An app description
    - UI flow mocks, similar to what you've seen in other Nanodegree projects, like the Popular Movies overview
    - A list of required tasks that you will complete to build the app, in order

The Capstone project will give you the experience you need to own the full development of an app. This first stage replicates the design and planning experience that proficient Android Developers are expected to demonstrate.
